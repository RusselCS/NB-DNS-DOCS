## How I've Hacked Netbattlers - A Brief Rundown On The Changes Made For My Nefarious Purposes

---
---
### Character Creation

---
This campaign uses some aged-up NetOp characters of about high school level. With the release of NetBattlers Advance, there is a ruleset dictating how these should be handled.
However, rather than developing the character more, they relinquish more stat numbers in addition to gaining Talents. Hence, character creation uses the following for stat and skill allocation:

- **NetOps** must allocate a pool of (2/2/1) to their Stats.
- **NetOps** must allocate a pool of (2/2/1/1/1) to their Skills.
- **NetOps** may also pick 2 **Talents**. Talents are skills, hobbies, or topics your character is interested in. These can be used to replace rolls on relevant skill checks.
- When creating a character, note the number of points visible next to **"Total Skill Increases."** For each point above 0, add a 1 to a Skill of your choice. (Skill allocations cannot exceed 5).
- Instead of Starting Chips, players are granted 500z for every Starting Chip they would have that they can spend on anything from the **shop**. An additional 500z is granted for each point in **Total Skill Increases** as well. Total formula for Starting Zenny is (Mind + Info + Skill Increases + 2) * 500z. **An additional 2000z is granted to players starting after the first Skill Increase.**

### Growing Up

---
Due to the pooled means of session in this game, all players level up at the same time. They are free to justify this growth in any way they feel, if at all. Every session grants one "Level Point" to everyone in the game. Once a certain number of "Level Points" have been attained, all characters level up. Leveling up is the same process as in normal NetBattlers- choose one Skill to add 1 point to. Skill allocations cannot exceed 5.

---
### Bonds

---
Once again, the pooled players and potential "drop-in"/"drop-out" system of *Drixel Net Squad* means that players are potentially transient and *many* relationships can form. When the players gain Skill Points from Growing Up, they will *also* gain a Bond Level with a character of their choice. This can be a player character or a friendly NPC. (Please do not bond with my vallains unless you somehow manage to get them to sit in a room and sing kumbaya). These Bonds are two-way--If Abigail bonds with Johann, both players gain 1 Bond Level. Spending and recovery of Bond Points are handled as normal- spending freetime with bonded players will restore bond points equal to the max of the bond levels between the player and all of players present during the freetime.  

**Example:** Abigail has a Bond Level of 2 with Johann and a Bond Level of 1 with Kirk. She spends 4 Bond Points during a particularly extreme scenario which necessitates Full Synchro. Afterwards, she spends an afternoon relaxing at the park with Johann and Kirk, where they recount the events of the past week. Abigail regains 2 of her 4 spent Bond Points.

### Respeccing

---
Being locked into a character you don't like playing *sucks!* I will be allowing players to _respec_ their character any number of times. **Respeccing** is rebuilding a character. Changing numbers around to better fit some alternative goal. As long as it's within reason, I will allow any number of these respecs all the way down from the beginning. As long as the result is somewhat appropriate to the character's theme, I will allow it.

My only request is you are reasonable in your decision for changing your character. I feel the need to specify this because I would rather you not respec because your character "underperformed" in some mission, job, episode, etc. Perhaps your character will perform better on the next one. Having a different character every session is lame, I ask you as the player to not abuse this system.

### Running Combat

---
As established in the rulebook, there is no pre-established means of determining turn order.  
If, for whatever reason, everyone wants to do something at the same time, a turn order will be established by asking everyone to roll NetOp Affinity. For ties, the NetOp with the highest total of Soul + Affinity will go first, for ties of *that*, check vs *just* Affinity. If all ties, roll NetOp Affinity again and repeat until there is a defined loser.  
  
Enemy turns will generally take place in-between player actions. A squad of 3 Mettaurs will have each Mettaur go between each player in a 3-person fight, for example.  
The turn order also floats. If someone wishes to take advantage of a situation, they're free to cut in as long as they didn't immediately go within the last few actions.  
  
This is the most apt location to add the following explanations for Chip tags.  
`Slow` Chips take a moment to activate. Often when they are used, at least one action should take place between the Chips being slotted in and it fully taking effect. You are usually written as "preparing an attack."  
`Dangerous` Chips tend to have side-effects that can be potentially negative to anyone caught in range. Explosives, an aura of evil, and strong elemental bursts may fall under this.  
`Awkward` Chips take a moment to *recover* from once their action is completed. The weapon could be heavy and have a lot of followthrough (ie Hammer, ChainRod), or the item requires moments to study and focus on (ie. SilverFist, MapView).

### Diagrams

---
My descriptive writing skills suck. So, oftentimes, I will be drawing vague diagrams to better give a visual representation of what's going on. However, it's necessary to elaborate the *vagueness* of these diagrams. They are meant to commuicate the absolute bear minimum information possible and should not be used to gauge exact positions. Exact positions don't matter most of the time in NetBattlers, so unless it's pointed out something is on the edge of a cliff about to fall, don't think that it is just because the token representing it is in the visual space.  

For example. Let's say MegaMan, GutsMan, and Roll are on a floating book in the middle of an infinite space-void and a Zomon appears and ambushes them. The Zomon jumps onto the book, landing on it gracefully with its sword drawn. When the Zomon is positioned in the diagram, it is merely slapped into position where it is most convenient, which could be somewhere on the edge of the book platform on the diagram. But recall where it was *described* to be. The Zomon is simply on the book, not necessarily on the edge. It could be in the middle of the group for all you know, it's just *on the book*.
