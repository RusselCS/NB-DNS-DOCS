##How I've Hacked Netbattlers - A Brief Rundown On The Changes Made For My Nefarious Purposes

---
---
###Character Creation

---
This campaign uses some aged-up NetOp characters of about high school level. With the release of NetBattlers Advance, there is a ruleset dictating how these should be handled.
However, rather than developing the character more, they relinquish more stat numbers in addition to gaining Talents. Hence, character creation uses the following for stat and skill allocation:

- **NetOps** must allocate a pool of (2/2/1) to their Stats.
- **NetOps** must allocate a pool of (2/2/1/1/1) to their Skills.
- **NetOps** may also pick 2 **Talents**. Talents are skills, hobbies, or topics your character is interested in. These can be used to replace rolls on relevant skill checks.
- When creating a character, note the number of points visible next to **"Total Skill Increases."** For each point above 0, add a 1 to a Skill of your choice. (Skill allocations cannot exceed 5).
- Rather than Starting Chips, players are granted 500z for every Starting Chip they would have that they can spend on anything from the **shop**. An additional 500z is granted for each point in **Total Skill Increases** as well. Total formula for Starting Zenny is (Mind + Info + Skill Increases + 2) * 500z.

###Growing Up

---
Due to the pooled means of session in this game, all players level up at the same time. They are free to justify this growth in any way they feel, if at all. Every session grants one "Level Point" to everyone in the game. Once a certain number of "Level Points" have been attained, all characters level up. Leveling up is the same process as in normal NetBattlers- choose one Skill to add 1 point to. Skill allocations cannot exceed 5.

### Bonds

---
Once again, the pooled players and potential "drop-in"/"drop-out" system of *Drixel Net Squad* means that players are potentially transient and *many* relationships can form. When the players gain Skill Points from Growing Up, they will *also* gain a Bond Level with a player of their choice. These Bonds are two-way--If Abigail bonds with Johann, both players gain 1 Bond Level. Spending and recovery of Bond Points are handled as normal- spending freetime with a bonded player will restore bond points equal to the bond level between the two.

**Example:** Abigail has a Bond Level of 2 with Johann. She spends 4 Bond Points during a particularly extreme scenario which necessitates Full Synchro. Afterwards, she spends an afternoon relaxing at the park with Johann, where they recount the events of the past week. Abigail regains 2 of her 4 spent Bond Points.

###Respeccing

---
Being locked into a character you don't like playing *sucks!* I will be allowing players to _respec_ their character any number of times. **Respeccing** is rebuilding a character. Changing numbers around to better fit some alternative goal. As long as it's within reason, I will allow any number of these respecs all the way down from the beginning. As long as the result is somewhat appropriate to the character's theme, I will allow it.

My only request is you are reasonable in your decision for changing your character. I feel the need to specify this because I would rather you not respec because your character "underperformed" in some mission, job, episode, etc. Perhaps your character will perform better on the next one. Having a different character every session is lame, I ask you as the player to not abuse this system.
